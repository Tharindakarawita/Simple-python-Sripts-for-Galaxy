        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This script extracts \"fusion\" annotated gene names from a GFF file, then retrieves the corresponding Gene IDs. It subsequently searches through the amino acid sequences to identify the corresponding amino acid sequence and outputs this information. The script is designed for use within the Galaxy platform, where users can easily run the script with their GFF and amino acid sequence files.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extracts \"fusion\" annotated gene names** from a GFF file.\n",
        "- **Retrieves Gene IDs** associated with the \"fusion\" annotations.\n",
        "- **Searches amino acid sequences** to find corresponding protein sequences.\n",
        "- **Outputs results** in a readable format, including matched amino acid sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3 is installed.\n",
        "- **Required libraries**:\n",
        "  - `BioPython` (for handling sequence data)\n",
        "  - `pandas` (for processing the GFF file)\n",
        "  - `Galaxy` (for integrating the script with the Galaxy platform)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Input\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **GFF File**: A GFF file containing gene annotations, specifically fusion gene annotations.\n",
        "2. **Amino Acid Sequence File**: A file containing the corresponding amino acid sequences (e.g., FASTA format).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output\n",

        "## Script Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Prepare Your Files\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **GFF File**: Ensure that your GFF file contains annotations of the \"fusion\" genes.\n",
        "2. **Amino Acid Sequences**: Prepare a FASTA file with amino acid sequences corresponding to the genes in your GFF file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Upload Files to Galaxy\n",
        "\n",
        "- Log into Galaxy.\n",
        "- Upload both the GFF file and the amino acid sequence file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Running the Script\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use the Galaxy interface to find and select the script.\n",
        "2. Provide the following inputs:\n",
        "   - GFF file (Fusion gene annotations).\n",
        "   - Amino acid sequence file (FASTA format).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Execute and Retrieve Results\n",
        "\n",
        "- Once the script is executed, the output file will display:\n",
        "  - The **Gene ID** for each fusion gene.\n",
        "  - The **corresponding amino acid sequence** for each Gene ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Command\n",
        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s an example of how the script works from the command line (if you prefer to run it outside Galaxy):\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python fusion_gene_extraction.py --gff fusion_annotations.gff --aa_sequence amino_acids.fasta --output fusion_gene_results.txt\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parameters:\n",
        "- `--gff`: Path to the GFF file with fusion gene annotations.\n",
        "- `--aa_sequence`: Path to the FASTA file containing amino acid sequences.\n",
        "- `--output`: Path to the file where results will be saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Troubleshooting\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Missing Gene IDs**: If no Gene IDs are extracted, ensure that the GFF file correctly includes the `gene_id` attribute in the `Attributes` column.\n",
        "- **No Sequence Match**: If a gene ID is missing from the amino acid sequence file, check if the sequence is named correctly and matches the Gene IDs from the GFF file.\n",
